          <p>• Market research companies typically have expertise in designing
            and conducting research studies. They understand the
            methodologies,

          <p>• External market research firms bring an objective perspective
            to
            the analysis. They are not influenced by internal biases or
            preconceptions, providing a more unbiased assessment of the market
